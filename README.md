# Day2Day-Planner
This is my daily planner.
When you open the planner then you are given a display of time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm with a display of the current date at the top of the calendar.When you view the blocks for that day you are given colour coded blocks to indicate whether it is in the past, present or future. When you click the time block then you can enter an event and click save on the right hand side of the block. When you refresh the page then the event is saved and you now have a daily planner!
